I am a PhD candidate in Xi'an Jiaotong University, majored in Software Engineering. Since September 2019, I started two-year visiting research in Intelligent Systems of Delft University of Technology, working with <a href="https://odettescharenborg.wordpress.com/">Dr. Scharenborg.</a> My research interests include visually ground speech learning, speech recognition/synthesis, computer vision, and multi-modal learning of speech and visual, e.g., speech-to-image generation and image-to-speech synthesis.
